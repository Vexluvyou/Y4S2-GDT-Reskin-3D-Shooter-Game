## Final Game Reskinning Requiment
***Instructions***
<br/>**Reskin and Reimagine Your Third-Person Shooter Game**

<br/> *Students who successfully completed the tutorial-based TPS game are now required to reskin the game. This includes changing visual assets, audio, interface, and potentially the theme, while keeping the core gameplay logic intact.*

<br/> Choose a new theme or concept for your game.
- Military
- Sci-Fi / Cyberpunk
- Urban Combat
- Fantasy
- Robot Invasion

Replace all default character models, animations, and enemies with assets that match your new theme.
- Use free assets
- At least 1 custom player character model
- At least 1 enemy type reskinned or redesigned
- All characters must be animated properly

Update the environment to match the new concept:
- Terrain, props, lighting, and skybox must be changed.
- You may redesign the layout, but gameplay flow must remain similar.

**Minimum requirement:**
- Replace 50% of visible environment assets.

### Deliverables
1. Before/After Screenshot Comparison (3–5 slides showing changes)
2. Short Video Demo (1–2 mins, gameplay walkthrough)
